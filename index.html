                <p>My name is Muhammet Alper Sayılır, and I was born on May 24, 2002, in Gaziantep, Turkey.
                    I completed my high school education at Gülşen Batar Anatolian High School graduating with honors in 2019.
                    In 2020, I began my English-taught Computer Engineering studies at Hasan Kalyoncu University with a full scholarship.
                    Throughout my university years, I was an active student, both as a member and a core team member in various clubs,
                    including the Erasmus Student Network HKU, Game Factory HKU, and HKU Sports Clubs.

                    During my university education,
                    I developed my skills in Python, C, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Oracle SQL, Unreal Engine, Unity, Blender, Arduino, and robotics. 
                    I had the opportunity to participate in the Erasmus+ exchange program at the University of Ostrava in the Czech Republic in both 2022 and 2024,
                    which significantly enhanced my problem-solving abilities and allowed me to work effectively with multicultural teams, ultimately broadening my horizons.

                            During this time, I traveled to 15 different European countries and improved my skills in both English and Czech.
                            This experience led me to decide that I want to live in Europe in the future.
                            I look forward to working with multicultural teams again based in Europe.</p>
